     <div><h2><strong>Our History</strong></h2>
  <h4>The Warriors were founded in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors.</h4> 
  <p>The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in Oakland, California. The Warriors compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. Founded in 1946 in Philadelphia, the Warriors relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1962 and undertook the city's name, before changing its geographic moniker to Golden State in 1971.[b] They play their home games at the Oracle Arena.

The Warriors won the inaugural Basketball Association of America (BAA) championship in 1947,[c] and won its second championship in 1956, led by Hall of Fame trident Paul Arizin, Tom Gola, and Neil Johnston. However, the Warriors would not return to similar heights in Philadelphia, and after a brief rebuilding period following the trade of star Wilt Chamberlain, the team moved to San Francisco. Under the guise of Jamaal Wilkes and Rick Barry, the Warriors returned to being title contenders, and won their third championship in 1975, in what is largely considered one of the biggest upsets in NBA history.

However, this preceded another period of struggle in the 1980s, before becoming playoff regulars to close the century with the rise of stars Tim Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin, colloquially referred to as "Run TMC". However, after failing to capture that elusive championship, the team entered another rebuilding phase in the 2000s. However, the team's fortunes changed in the 2010s, ushering in a new era of success led by Stephen Curry. After also drafting perennial All-Stars Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, the team returned to championship glory in 2015, before winning another two in 2017 and 2018 after adding former league MVP Kevin Durant.

Nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of "W's",[7][8] the Warriors hold several NBA records; they have registered the best ever regular season, most wins in a season (regular season and postseason combined), as well as the best ever postseason run. The team's six NBA championships are tied for third-most in NBA history with the Chicago Bulls. According to Forbes, the Warriors are the seventh highest valued sports franchise in the United States, and joint-tenth in the world, with an estimated value of approximately $3.1 billion.[9]</p>
